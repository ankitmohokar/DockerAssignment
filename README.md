# DockerAssignment
Docker Assignment(RESTful service) using Python and Flask
Saksham Chandrawat and I have created a docker container running on Python and Flask.
This container runs a RESTful service which displays collection of records and also displays single record assigned to a specific ID.

In order to run:

Build the image using command: docker build -t flaskfinalv13

Run the Docker container using the command: docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flaskfinalcontv13
